    <h1>First Fight</h1>
    <p>Cameron replaces his fear with confidence as best as he can, and approaches the dragon. Drawing his sword, he musters up his hope and warns the dragon,
      "I won't let you touch my sensei."
    </p>
    <p>"You are mearly hiding your fear behind a wall of insecurity.  Truly Lucious' pupil." the dragon taunts, lifting his sword above his head to strike down.</p>
    <p>Cam lifts his sword above him, blocking the shot. He goes to slash to the left, but the beast meets him in the middle, before going to strike again. Chase jumps to the side, and Lucious runs over, cutting the beast in half.
      "You ok?" he asks, concerned for his friend.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm good." Cameron says, sheething his sword.</p>
    <p>"I took out the other two pretty quickly, so I went to see if you needed help.  Let's go check on sensei." Lucious explains.</p>
    <p>The two start walking towards the monostary, when the building errupts into flames.  Lucious starts running over,
      with Cam following close behind.
