    <h1>Warning</h1>
    <p>Fearing his life, Cameron runs to the entrance to the main building, hoping to warn his master. When he reaches the door, he feels a great pain in his heart. He looks down to see a broadsword, halfway through his chest.
      "Cameron!!" he hears Lucious calling out, as his senses fade.
