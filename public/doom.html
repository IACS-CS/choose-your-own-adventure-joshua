    <h1>Doom</h1>
    <p>As the two friends approach the burning building, they see a winged dragon flying above, holding their sensei by his shirt collar.
      "Don't worry! He's not awake, but he's not asleep," says an unsettling voice from above.
    </p>
    <p>"Put him down!" Cameron yelled, having enough of the Dragons at this point.
    </p>
    <p>"What do you want, Pyro!" Lucious yelled, clearly thinking the same.
    </p>
    <p>"Lucious! So you DO remember me!" Pyro snarled. "I hope you remember my 'Old Friend,' because he's coming back to town!"
    </p>
    <p>As the two argued, Cameron runs back to the fountain in the center of the courtyard to try to put out the fire. He fills a bucket swiftly, before the water floats up from th inside.
      "Foolish boy." Said a stern voice. "Pyro's flame is eternal."
    </p>
    <p>Cameron looked up to see a blue dragon with yellow accents.
      "you're a water dragon, aren't you?" Cameron asked.
    </p>
    <p>"The last you'll ever see if you try to save him." The creature explained. "I am Hydro, leader of the water dragons and second seat on the Dragon Council. Farewell, child."
    </p>
    <p>The dragon jmped up and started flying towards Pyro.  Cameron looked over, and both dragons were gone.
      "Don't worry, it's not you're fault." Lucious said as he walked over to Cameromn.
    </p>
    <p>"What are we going to do?" Cameron asked, concerned for his sensei.
    </p>
    <p>Lucious, already walking towards the bashed in gate, turned back to his friend.
      "We're gonna go kill some dragons." He said. "Let's head to
      <a href="town.html">town</a>
      and get you a sword"
