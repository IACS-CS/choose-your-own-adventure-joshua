    <p>"I'm gonna head in." Cameron stated with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>"Wise choice." Lucious said. "Maybe he'll let you get a custom mold. But it'll cost extra."
    </p>
    <p>The two enter the building and walk to the counter, where a green ooze dragon is shining a plate.
      "Hey, Draggino." Lucious aid.
    </p>
    <p>The dragon turned around, with a big toothy grin on his face.

    </p>
    <p>"Actually, we'd like to order something off the menu." Lucious said in a sly tone. "It's his first time."
    </p>
    <p>"I see." Draggino siad, dropping his friendly tone. "Follow me."</p>
    <p>The three headed to the back room, which was lined with swords.</p>
