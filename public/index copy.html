    <h1>Dragon Slayer</h1>
    <p>10 years ago, during the Great Dragon War, the Dark Dragon threatened the land, and the dreaded mercenary sought to eliminate all life as we know it. During the height of the war, the mercenary slayed Pyro, the host of the Dark Dragon. It seemed all life was doomed, but then... he dissapeared. And a year of fighting later, Dragon World returned to peace.</p>
    <p>Now, Pyro has returned with the Dragon Council, seeking to resurrect their master and threaten that peace. Hope lays gently in the hands of two heros, pupils of the Sensei, the last of the wise men and the Council's target.</p>
