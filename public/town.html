    <h1>Canyon Town</h1>
    <p>The pair walk through the bustling streets of their local village, looking to aquire a sword fit for slaying beasts.
      "Here we are," Lucious said as he stopped and looked to his left. "Draggino's."
    </p>
    <p>"Isn't this place outlawed?" Cameron asked, concerned.
    </p>
    <p>"They're technicaly not supposed to sell weapons anymore." Lucious said. "But I'm friends with the owner. I'm sure he'll hook you up."
    </p>
    <p>Cameron looked at the building, considering if it was worth breaking the law to rescue sensei. He knew Draggino, and didn't want to get him arrested.
      "You don't have to come in if you don't want to." Lucious said, comferting his friend.
    </p>
    <p>Cameron weighed his options. Should he
      enter
      and risk getting a good friend arrested?
      Or should he
      wait
      outside?
