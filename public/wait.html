    <h1>Inner Thoughts</h1>
    <p>"I think I'm gonna wait out here." Cameron said, feeling he was making the right choice.
    </p>
    <p>"Alright, I'll meet you out here when I'm done." Said Lucious, in a calm tone.</p>
    <p>Cameron sat on a bench outside the piuub, thinking about what had happened to that day.
      <ul>
        <li>He couldn't win a fight despite his training.</li>
        <li>His sensei had been kidnapped by a maniac.</li>
        <li>His home was set on eternal fire.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Overall he just felt down, knowing he probably could have done more.
      "And I thought I was depressing." Said a joking Lucious from behind him.
    </p>
    <p>"It's been a rough day." Cameron responded.</p>
    <p>Cam closed his eyes to think some more when he felt smooth darksteel in his hands. He looked down to see a sleek shiny broadsword resting on his hands.
      "What do you think?" Lucious asked.
    </p>
    <p>Cam clutched the hilt of the sword in his right hand, stood up, and turned to lucios.
      "Let's go kill some dragons."
